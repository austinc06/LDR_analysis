# Purpose
The purpose of the project is to practice coding in R and do some simple data curation and visualization in R.

# Topic of Interest
The focus of the project is inspired by a few postings on reddit's r/dataisbeautiful subreddit. I took the text history between my girlfriend and myself from the last six years (via What'sapp downloadable history) and did some simple analysis of our texting patterns.

# Project Outline
1) Download text history from What'sapp
2) Clean text data
3) Calculate additional parameters
4) Visualize data

# Code Documentation
## Notebooks
1) LDR_analysis.Rmd\
The primary notebook containing all the code from loading source data, data curation, calculations, and data visualization. To view, download LDR_analysis.html (which is the html knit) to see the output report.
